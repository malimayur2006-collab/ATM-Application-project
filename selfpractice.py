# 1. Write a python to print to number form 1 to 10 using for loop

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i)

# 2.Write a program to take a number from the user and check whether it is even and odd

# num =int(input("Enter any number:"))
# if num % 2 == 0:
#     print("The number is Even")
# else:
#     print(" The number is Odd")

# 3.Write a program to find the sum of first N natural number

# n =int(input("Enter a number : "))
# sum=0
# for i in range(1,n +1):
#     sum+=i
 
#     print("sum of first ",n ,"natural number is: ",sum)   

# 4. write a program to print the multiplication table of given number
# num = int(input("Enter any number:  "))
 
# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(num," * ",i," = ",num*i)


# write a python program to find the largest of three number 
# for i in range():
#     print(i)

# write a python program to reverse a number

# for i in range(10,0,-1):
#     print(i)

# Write a program to Calculate the factorial of a number using a loop

# using while loop 

# n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
# fact =1
# i=1
# while i<=n:
#     fact=fact*i
